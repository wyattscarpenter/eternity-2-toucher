# eternity-2-toucher

possibly consider the name Etwornity for this project? 2Eternity2Solver? E2Eternity?

Try to solve eternity 2, sure, why not. Eternity II, which I call eternity 2, is described on this web page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternity_II_puzzle

I use the piece list from https://groups.io/g/eternity2/message/10970, (note from #11516 in https://groups.io/g/eternity2/topic/eternity_piece_list/112638051: "Piece #139 (line 139 in the list above with the values "6 11 18 6") has to be placed in row 9 column 8. It has to be placed so that the edges with number 6 are on the right and down directions.") and the hints from [e2.bucas.name's "Clues" preset](https://e2.bucas.name/#puzzle=Clues&board_w=16&board_h=16&board_edges=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargouaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaartrjaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaavddoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaajdsoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaafsknaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa&board_pieces=000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000208000000000000000000000000000000255000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000139000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000181000000000000000000000000000000249000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000&motifs_order=jef)

After thinking a lot about this problem, I realized I wasn't going to solve it. It's literally an np-hard problem, probably. And smart guys who can program have been looking at it for decades, and I'm not even that smart nor is my computer even that good. Also, I decided to sink my chances right off the bat by using Python. Could switch to Rust but ehhhhh. Anyway, at least maybe I'll get some nice visualizations or something.

After much thinking about using solutions that were, in retrospect, basically just backtrackers, I've had the brilliant idea to use a "sieve" method (which is probably also isomorphic to a backtracker).
